# Code of Conduct Sign For WordCamps & Events

This is a sign (24" x 36") used at WordCamp Miami 2016 and 2017. If you are running an event, the provided PSD could be a great way to jump start a sign of your own or feel free just to replace the contact info and logo with your own.

# Tips

We found it to be most effective to place one sign near the registration line or desk for the entire conference. That way, people can't miss it (everyone should be walking by it on their way to register). Of course additional signs in key areas at the conference and conference events (like after parties, Contributor days, etc) are wise along with the usual mentions in print and on the website.

# Pull Requests Welcome

I would love to see various sizes of signs to meet particular needs of various conferences. Change the text of your sign as you see fit. I would love to see different signs submitted.
