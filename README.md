# Code of Conduct Sign For WordCamps & Events

This is a sign (24" x 36") used at WordCamp Miami 2016 and 2017. If you are running an event, the provided PSD could be a great way to jump start a sign of your own or feel free just to replace the contact info and logo with your own.

# Tips

1. We found it to be most effective to place one sign near the registration line or desk for the entire conference. That way, people can't miss it (everyone should be walking by it on their way to register). 
2. Of course additional signs in key areas at the conference and conference events (like after parties, Contributor days, etc) are wise along with the usual mentions in print and on the website.
3. A brief mention at the opening remarks about expected behavior is a good idea, and you can always refer people to read the sign at registration (or the more detailed item on the website).
4. Always make sure the names and contacts you mention on the site aren't just one gender. Diversity will allow people who feel they need to report something feel more comfortable approaching someone on your team.
5. Brief volunteers and organizers before the event on the procedures.

# Pull Requests Welcome

I would love to see various sizes of signs to meet particular needs of various conferences. Change the text of your sign as you see fit. I would love to see different signs submitted.
